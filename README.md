## About the Video Course

Laravel is a prominent member of a new generation of web frameworks. It is one of the most popular PHP frameworks and is also free and open source. Laravel 5 is a substantial upgrade with a lot of new toys, at the same time retaining the features that made Laravel wildly successful. It comes with plenty of architectural as well as design-based changes. Extending Laravel with First-Party packages focuses on using packages with a specific emphasis on First-Party packages that are built by the Laravel team to add functionality shared by many apps. You will be able to add additional and essential functionalities to the core framework that you can pull in as needed, without adding unnecessary bloat to the framework. 

The course begins by extending the basic traditional authentication and you will now learn how to add social sign-on capabilities with the Laravel Socialite package.

You will then see how different types of search and multiple indexes can be managed easily with the help of Laravel Scout and how Laravel manages and updates servers. 

Finally, you will master using Laravel Cashier to connect with popular payment gateways to make it easy to start accepting payments. 

Towards the end of the video course, you will get your hands dirty with one of the coolest applications on the internet now—update live and broadcast—without refreshing the page. You will be known as soon as a user comments on a post, with the page refreshing in real time.
